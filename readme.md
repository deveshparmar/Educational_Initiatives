# Smart Home System
**The Smart Home System is a Java-based application that simulates a smart home system, allowing users to control various smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks via a central hub. Users can set schedules, automate tasks, view device status, and manage triggers.**

## Built with
Java (JDK-20)

## Features
- Initialize the Smart Home System with different devices, each having a unique ID and type (light, thermostat, door lock).
- Turn devices on/off.
- Schedule devices to turn on/off at a particular time.
- Automate tasks based on triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature).
- Add and remove devices dynamically.
- Custom exceptions for handling unsupported actions and invalid trigger conditions.
